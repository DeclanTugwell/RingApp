.Net Maui Ring Application that I made over the weekend.

Very basic functionality, simply allows you to login with your ring account and then deactivate the motion detection for a period of time.

Created this as my parents kept showing me vidoes of me getting home after nights out... Never again.

[Repo](https://github.com/dgreif/ring?tab=readme-ov-file) that I found very helpful for finding all the Ring Api endpoints.
